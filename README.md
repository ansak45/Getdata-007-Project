Getdata-007-Project
===================

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

For this project, the data was collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The input data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script generates 'tidy_data.txt' output file. ##it was uploaded as part of submission.
